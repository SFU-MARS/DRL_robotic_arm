### List of trained models

Models are stored here. The files needed to reproduce the result (e.g. parameters, algorithm modifications) exactly are presented in `_modelFiles`.

##### gripperEnabled
- `cmd.sh`: parameters to train the model
- `ppo.py`: modified PPO algorithm (copy and replace the (pytorch) PPO algorithm in OpenAI Spinning Up)
- `reach.py` : modified FetchReach environment (copy and replace into OpenAI Spinning Up)
